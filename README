# All Quests Checkmarks
A mod for SPT that overhauls quest checkmarks for items by checking for future quests and slightly changing how default logic checks for quest items. It also adds detailed description to tooltips that show: how many items are currently in stash, total required items for all quests, active, future quests and other players who need this item (FIKA users only). This mod works only for quest types of: handover item, find item and leave item at Location. Markers, Wi-Fi Cameras and Jammers are completely excluded. This mod also works with FIKA and marks items required for quests of your squad members. This mod completely overrides default logic of checkmarks so other mods that also alter checkmarks will most likely not work!

More detailed description and screenshots are available on [SPT Hub](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/2705-all-quests-checkmarks/).

## Changed Logic
* If selected in config, this mod will also mark non-FiR items that are required for active quests with default yellow checkmark.
* Items required for upcoming quests are marked with checkmark of different color (also includes non-FiR items if selected in config).

## Default Colors
* **Magenta** - Item found in raid and is required for future quests
* **Dark purple** - Item **not** found in raid but is required for future quests
* **Light red** - Neither of above, but is required for at least one active quest of your squad members (**FIKA only**)
